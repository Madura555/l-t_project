In this project, Transformer design parameters and its losses are calculated

INTRODUCTION TO TRANSFORMER:
  Transformer is AC static electromagnetic machine (as it has no moving part) which steps up or downs the voltage level in power system keeping power at constant levels and frequency remains unchanged. In simplest form, it consist of two coils wound on an iron core. It works on law of electromagnetic induction.    
        It is based upon mutual induction between two coils. When current flows, there is magnetic field around the conductor. As magnetic current is due to changing current (AC) the Â­magnetic field is also alternating. It magnetize the iron/steel core, voltage is induced in other coil. This is basics of transformer. Both sides are magnetically linked and no electrical connection between them so it is also isolates the primary circuits and secondary circuits.

THE NEED FOR TRANSFORMER IN ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM:
  Transmission of electrical power over long distances occur a great loss in power. As the power losses is given by (I^2)R so when power system has to feed a big load of high current and it has to travel over a long distance, a handful amount of power will be lost. Also causes huge voltage drop to the receiving end. As voltage level can be increased using this device and as this keeps the power constant so with increase in voltage level, current reduces hence losses are reduced. This device replaces the whole DC transmission system to AC system.

  VARIOUS LOSSES IN TRANSFORMER:
    There are various types of losses in the transformer such as iron loss, copper loss, hysteresis loss, eddy current loss, stray loss, and dielectric loss.
    
  IRON LOSS:
    Iron losses are caused by the alternating flux in the core of the transformer as this loss occurs in the core it is also known as Core loss. Iron loss is further divided into hysteresis and eddy current loss.
    Hysteresis Loss:
The core of the transformer is subjected to an alternating magnetizing force, and for each cycle of emf, a hysteresis loop is traced out. Power is dissipated in the form of heat known as hysteresis loss 
    Eddy current Loss:
By the effect of Eddy Current the heat which is produced is not utilized for any useful work as they are a major source of energy loss in AC machines like transformer, generators, and motors. Therefore, it is known as an Eddy Current Loss. 

Copper Loss Or Ohmic Loss
These losses occur due to ohmic resistance of the transformer windings. If I1 and I2 are the primary and the secondary current. R1 and R2 are the resistance of primary and secondary winding then the copper losses occurring in the primary and secondary winding will be I12R1 and I22R2 respectively.
